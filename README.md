# 2-Layer Perceptron on Iris Dataset

This repository contains a simple implementation of a 2-layer perceptron (a basic neural network) built from scratch for classifying the Iris dataset. The goal is to use a perceptron model to learn and classify the different species of Iris flowers based on their features.
